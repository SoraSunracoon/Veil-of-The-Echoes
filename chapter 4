Azrael was confused , he knew that everything that happened was real.
But something strange, no one remembers what happens like stuff that happened back there which was never real, but

"Status open" Azrael said
Feeling embarrassed to say such a thing, he saw

[Class: Shadow Weaver]
[Item : Eye of the Echoes ]

The moment he started looking at his status the monster appeared out of nowhere
[The monster looked disgusting, like that come out of a crazy nightmare resembling fears of someone but not really ] , awakened. Attacked each other; they wanted to kill each other more than the other monster. He felt out of place . He watend to survive . To live after baxac the power he gived him. Was just an "Eye of Echoes" he just thought it's just an eye
The moment a monster attacked him he was not alone they where 3 monster backing him up
"Baxac" azrael screamed
The eye of echoes activated himself
A sword showed itself before him , resembling of baxac on the sword. The grace of a beautiful sword where all people treated him like a failure, blue pattern katana, Like he felt he was still with him no matter what , cherishing the moment, he felt secure with baxac on his side he started swinging the sword , like he had a clue but he couldn't even hit the monster in front of him , The white hair Girl come in defense of him

"Don't you know how to use a sword " She screamed.

She looked confused at the same time
"Why the king of all living failure is now his sword " The white hair lady thought.

Slicing the monster like it was nothing , like she know what she was doing ...
